Building
========

Check out from the repository.  Install Boo and its NAnt task.  Run 'nant' from
the top level.

Running
=======

While developing, the easiest way to run Renraku is to set up GRUB and a Tftp
server, then boot kernel.bin from the Obj directory.

Otherwise, boot kernel.bin via GRUB from a filesystem.
